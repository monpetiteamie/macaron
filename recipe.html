		<h3>Let's Start Baking!</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 300F degrees. Line 3 baking sheets with silicone mats. Combine and whisk the confectioners' sugar and almond flour in a bowl</li>
			<li>Sift the sugar-almond flour mixture through a sieve into a large bowl</li>
			<li>Beat the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt with a mixer on medium speed until frothy. Increase the speed to medium high; gradually add the superfine sugar and beat until stiff and shiny, about 5 more minutes.</li>
			<li>Transfer the whites to the bowl with the sugar-almond flour mixture. Draw a rubber spatula halfway through the mixture and fold until incorporated, giving the bowl a quarter turn with each fold.</li>
			<li>Add the food coloring and extract. Continue folding and turning, scraping down the bowl, until the batter is smooth and falls off the spatula in a thin flat ribbon, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
			<li>Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with the tip. Holding the bag vertically and close to the baking sheet, pipe 24, 1 1/4-inch circles. Tap the baking sheets against the counter to release air bubbles.</li>
			<li>Let the macarons sit at room temp until the tops are no longer sticky. Slip another baking sheet under the first batch to protect the cookies from the heat.</li>
			<li>Bake the first batch until the cookies are shiny and rise 1/8 inch to form a "foot,". Transfer to a rack to cool completely. Repeat, using a double sheet for each batch. Peel the cookies off the mats and sandwich with a thin layer of jam.</li>
			</ol>
