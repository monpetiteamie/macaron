		<!--History taken from wikipedia-->
		
		<p>The first known appearance of the macaron in Europe was all the way back in the Middle Ages. Catherine de' Medici likely brought the maccherone to France in the 16th century from Italy, where it had been produced in Venetian monasteries since the 8th century. Back then, they were rather humbly called 'priest's bellybuttons, due to the pastry's shape. <br><br>The popularization of the macaron started during the French Revolution, when two Carmelite nuns in Nancy baked and sold macarons in order to survive. They became known as the 'Macaron Sisters.' In 1952, the city of Nancy honored the two nuns by naming the spot where they produced the macarons after them. <br><br>The macaron has since experienced a burst of popularity in North America, China, Japan, and South Korea.</p>
