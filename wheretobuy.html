		<p>Arguably the most famous in the world of macarons is Laduree, a French luxury bakery and sweets maker house created in 1862. Pierre Desfontaines, cousin of Louis Ernest Laduree, created the first Laduree macaron by having the genius to stick two macaron cookies together and fill them with a flavorful ganache. 
		Ever since then, the preparation has stayed the same. Each season Laduree celebrates this little round cake that's crispy outside and soft inside, a perfect balance of aromas and textures, by creating new flavors. Each year the palette of flavors and colors grows, from the classic chocolate or raspberry to festive macarons, exotic flavours for certain destinations, fashion designers and perfumes. It is also one of the world's best-known premier sellers of the double-decker macaron, fifteen thousand of which are sold every day.</p>
		<h3><a class="textlink" href="http://www.macaroncafe.com/">Macaron Cafe <br> (Midtown Upper East Side, Garment District)</a></h3>
		<p>MacarOn Cafe was established to pay homage to the delicate French confectionery, the macaron. Master chef, Cecile Cannone, whips up time-tested flavors, like raspberry and chocolate, to the seasonal and eclectic, such as pumpkin and violet flower. Cecile Cannone and MacarOn Cafeâ€™s pastry chefs are dedicated to pleasing your taste buds with their sinfully delicious Macarons.</p>
		<h4><a class="textlink" href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/bouchon-bakery-and-cafe-new-york-2/">Bouchon Bakery <br> (Midtown)</a></h4>
		<p>In 2003, Chef Thomas Keller opened the doors of his first Bouchon Bakery. Bouchon Bakery was first conceived as a way to provide neighboring restaurants with one-of-a-kind breads. In the style of classic French boulangeries, the bakery features a wide selection of artisanal breads and classic desserts.</p>
